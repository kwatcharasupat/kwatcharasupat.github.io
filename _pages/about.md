I am a PhD student in Music Technology at the <a href="https://musicinformatics.gatech.edu/">Music Informatics Group</a>, Georgia Institute of Technology under <a href="https://www.alexanderlerch.com/"> Assoc Prof Alexander Lerch</a>. I work basically on anything machine learning and signal processing for audio and music applications, as long as I am not trying to replace human creativity. For now, it looks like I will be focusing on audio source separation for a while.

Outside of research, I play the euphonium (and other brass instruments). I compose and arrange for wind band once in a while, although you could imagine that there are a lot of unfinished projects on my past and present laptops.

In case you have not noticed, there is a chance that I am actually a cat. That would explain a lot of things...
