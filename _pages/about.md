I am a PhD student in Music Technology at the <a href="https://musicinformatics.gatech.edu/">Music Informatics Group</a>, Georgia Institute of Technology under <a href="https://www.alexanderlerch.com/"> Prof Alexander Lerch</a>. I work basically on anything machine learning and signal processing for audio and music applications, as long as I am not trying to replace human creativity. For now, it looks like I will be focusing on audio source separation for a while. 

Places I once caused chaos in include: [Apple](https://machinelearning.apple.com/)'s Acoustics Machine Learning and Acoustics User Studies Teams, [Netflix](https://research.netflix.com/)'s Audio Algorithms Team, [Prof Woon-Seng Gan](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00961)'s Digital Signal Processing Lab and [Smart Nation Translational Lab](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/sntl), [Aevice Health](https://aevice.com/), and [A/P Andy Khong](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/andykhong/index.htm)'s Group. 

Outside of research, I play the euphonium (and other brass instruments). I compose and arrange for wind band once in a while, although you could imagine that there are a lot of unfinished projects on my past and present laptops.

In case you have not noticed, there is a chance that I am actually a cat. That would explain a lot of things...
